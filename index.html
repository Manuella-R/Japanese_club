              <p><strong>🎪 Club Fair 2025:</strong> We kicked off the year with an exciting Club Fair! Thanks to the incredible support from <strong>Baraka and Perez from the Embassy</strong>, a wonderful representative from <strong>JICA</strong>, and our dedicated team members <strong>Mark and Clara</strong>, we had a fantastic turnout with many new registrations!</p>

                <h4>💡 Challenges & Insights</h4>
                <p>The main challenge we faced was that most council members and students were participating in their <strong>WBL (Work-Based Learning)</strong> and <strong>SBL (Service-Based Learning)</strong> programs during Jan-April. This has historically been our biggest hurdle - with fewer people on campus, event attendance and engagement naturally dip during this period.</p>

                <h4>✨ Why It Worked</h4>
